    "- `volatile acidity`: the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at high levels can lead to an unpleasant vinegar taste\n",
    "- `citric acid`: found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines\n",
    "- `residual sugar`: the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it's rare to find wines with less than 1 fram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet\n",
    "- `chlorides`: the amount of salt in the wine\n",
    "- `free sulfur dioxide`: the free form of SO2 exists in equilibtrium between molecular SO2 (dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial groth and the oxidation of wine\n",
    "- `total sulfur dioxide`: amount of free and bound forms of SO2; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but becomes evident in the smell and taste at free SO2 concetrations over 50 ppm\n",
    "- `density`: the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content\n",
    "- `pH`: describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 pH\n",
    "- `sulfates`: wine addiitve that contributes to SO2 contentrations in the wine\n",
    "- `alchohol`: the alcohol content concentration of the wine\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- `quality`: score between 0 to 10\n",
